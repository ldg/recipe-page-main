## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

With this project I set up a series of mixins to manage the different text presets. In my previous challenge I tried setting up css custom properties to use for a font shorthand property. For reasons unknown I couldn't get that to work, so this project I turned to Sass's mixins and set up all the styels there and added it to my styles with an `@include mixin-name;`.

### Continued development

I'll continue to focus on the Sass workflow, as I work through Frontend Mentor's learning path challenges.
